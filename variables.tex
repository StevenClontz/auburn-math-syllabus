\centerline{\url{https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassAttendance.pdf}}\\

% Contingency Plan
% The default setting allows you to change this syllabus as needed (for example, giving one less exam due to time constraints), but you should present the changed policy in writing to your class.
\newcommand{\ContPlan}{
If normal class and/or lab activities are disrupted due to illness, emergency, or crisis situation, the syllabus and other course plans and assignments may be modified to allow completion of the course. If this occurs, an addendum to your syllabus and/or course assignments will replace the original materials.
