% Grade Description
  % Written explanation of grading schema. Current policy (2013-01-01) lets instructors 
  % set own grading schema with approval by course coordinator
\newcommand{\GradeDesc}{
The majority of the grade will be determined by a midterm and final exam, with some credit coming from weekly quizzes.
}

% Makeup Policy
  % University policy requires that one week is given for a student to give notice of an 
  % excused absence for an exam, so altering this is not recommended.
\newcommand{\MakeUp}{
The Midterm and Final can only be made-up if there is a university excuse presented within one week of the regularly scheduled exam. Refer to \\
\centerline{\url{https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassAttendance.pdf}}\\ 
for the list of acceptable excuses. It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements for any work and/or notes missed due to an absence. 

The instructor must be notified by email within 24 hours of missing the exam that an excuse will be presented. Failure to give adequate notice may result in a 10\% deduction in grade on the exam. Foreseeable absences (such as band or athletic trips) must be reported to the instructor one week in advance.

Quizzes missed due to an excused absence are not required to be made up - instead, the next quiz's grade will be counted toward the missed quiz.
}

% ADA Policy
  % Don't change this without good reason.
\newcommand{\ADA}{
Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting during office hours the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. If you have a conflict with my office hours, an alternate time can be arranged. To set up this meeting, please contact me by e-mail. If you have not established accommodations through the Office of Accessibility, but need accommodations, make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center, 844-2096 (V/TT).
}

% Academic Honesty
  % Similarly, this probably shouldn't be changed.
\newcommand{\AcaHon}{
All portions of the Auburn University student academic honesty code (Title XII) \\
\centerline{\url{https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/AcademicHonestyCode.pdf}} \\
will apply to this class. All academic honesty violations or alleged violations of the SGA Code of Laws will be reported to the Office of the Provost, which will then refer the case to the Academic Honesty Committee. \textbf{Tiger Cards may be checked before any assignment is accepted.}\\
\centerline{\it ``I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and confidence of my fellow men.''}
}

% Contingency Plan
  % The default setting allows you to change this syllabus as needed 
  % (for example, giving one less exam due to time constraints), 
  % but you should present the changed policy in writing to your class.
\newcommand{\ContPlan}{
If normal class and/or lab activities are disrupted due to illness, emergency, or crisis situation, the syllabus and other course plans and assignments may be modified to allow completion of the course. If this occurs, an addendum to your syllabus and/or course assignments will replace the original materials.
