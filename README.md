# auburn-math-syllabus

This is a LaTeX template for the Auburn University math department syllabus template. The goal is to provide TeX-savvy instuctors a way to make a few small changes and easily generate a PDF syllabus fitting departmental policy.

[Here's what the finished product looks like.](https://github.com/StevenClontz/auburn-math-syllabus/blob/master/syllabus.pdf?raw=true)

## How to Use

If you're not familiar with Git - no worries. You can easily download the bundle of files from the cloud by clicking the "ZIP" button. [Or you can just click this sentence.](https://github.com/StevenClontz/auburn-math-syllabus/archive/master.zip) Load up the variables.tex file in your favorite LaTeX editor, make the necessary changes, and then compile syllabus.tex to update the syllabus.pdf file.

Or if you want to get fancy, you can use your own GitHub account to "Fork" this repository. You can then use Git to clone the repo locally to your computer, make your changes, and maintain your syllabus with some helpful version control and online backup. 

(Seriously, even if you're not a coder, I suggest you take a look into Git for maintaining your syllabus/article/book... it's a very convenient way to maintain TeX documents, particularly if you want to share your work with others, and *especially* if you want to collaborate with others. Find me around Parker Hall and I'll be happy to show you the ropes.)

## How to Contribute

This is just something I hacked out in a few hours since I knew I wouldn't be the only person to prefer a LaTeX syllabus rather than editing a Word doc. I'm sure there's a lot that could be fixed.

If you are comfortable with GitHub you are free to submit a Pull Request, or I'd probably be happy to give you edit privileges to the repo directly.

Alternately, just shoot me an email at <steven.clontz@gmail.com> with suggested changes and I'll look into it.

### Who are you?...

I'm Steven Clontz. I'm a PhD candidate in mathematics at Auburn Unviersity. You could probably guess that since this project is for math GTAs at Auburn. Ah well. Here's my blog if you care: <http://www.stevenclontz.com>

### Who owns this? Who can use it?

This is a derivative work of a Word document written by Dr. T. Y. Tam, department head of Mathematics at Auburn University, adapted for use only by Auburn math instructors.

Others who might want to adapt this for their own syllabi may do so, but must rewrite all suggested text and remove any association from the Auburn mathematics department. Thanks in advance.
